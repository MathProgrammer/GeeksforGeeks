- It is never optimal to have a group of size $\ge 4$. We can always split it to have at least the same sum. A component of size $5$ can be split into two components of sizes $3$ and $2$ with a larger product. We can do this with all integers $\ge 4$.
- In order to maximise the product, we will make components of $3$ vertices. We will make a final component of size $2$ or $4$ depending on the remainder $\pmod 3$.
- When we want to maximise the number of edges in the graph, we will make each $3-$component have only $2$ edges and when we want to maximise it, we will make each of the $3$ components have $3$ edges.

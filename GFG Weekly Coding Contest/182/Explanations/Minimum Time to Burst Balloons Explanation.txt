First of all, we can pick up all balloons at position 0 with no cost. 

So, k = k - (balloons at 0). 

----

We will now solve the problem for the reduced k. 

Let us look at negative and positive numbers separately. 

The optimal path will look like this - 

1. Take some number of elements along one direction. 
2. Turn around and reach the origin (If k balloons are not over)
3. The the remaining elements from the other direction. 

Note that it is never optimal to take positive - negative - positive 
We will always do at most one U turn to the origin. 

Let us keep two separate vectors for the positive and negative numbers. 

Fix i, where i is the number of balloons on the positive path, before the U-turn. 
And take the remaining balloons from the negative side. 

This will enable us to iterate over all possibiliies.

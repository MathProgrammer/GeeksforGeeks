Let us build a new graph, which only has edges between vertices who's 
distance is <= k 

Since the original graph was a tree, this new graph consists 
of multiple (possibly 1) components, which are all trees. 

We will have to find the longest path in each component. 

The longest path in a given component is the diameter of the component. 

We can find the diameter using the following procedure - 

1. Do DFS and find the furthest leaf from a node v. 
2. Do DFS from this leaf and find the furthest vertex from it. 

This will give us the two ends of the diamter. 

I made a mistake here where I was creating a distance vector of size N for each 
component. This was leading to TLE since there could be N components of size 1 
in the worst case.

Instead of simulating each query by XOR-ing every 
A[i] in [L, R] with X, 

Let us instead think of which queries influence i ? 
A[i] = XOR() of all X's  which begin before it and end after it. 

Let us keep track of the beginning and ending of each query. 

We can use the fact XOR(x, x) = 0

A[i] = A[i - 1]^queries_beginning[i]

We also have to remove queries which have ended. We can remove a query 
by XOR-ing with it again

This is the final expression

A[i] = A[i - 1]^queries_beginning[i]^queries_ending[i]
